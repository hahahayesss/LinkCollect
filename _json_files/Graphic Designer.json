My studies began in college with a BTEC in Fashion and Textiles, followed by a degree in Fashion Design at the critically acclaimed, Nottingham Trent University.  Following graduation, I began my career as a Graphics and Print Designer in the Fashion and Creative Industries, which has seen me located in various places across the UK, as well as relocating to New York City. Whilst at these various locations, I\u2019ve been lucky enough to design for some of the largest companies in the world;  including Walmart, Tesco, Asda, Wilkinsons and Clinton's Cards, amongst many others. My designs have spanned a diversity of products, including marketing material, promotional literature, branding, POS, Fashion, Greeting Cards, Activity products, Giftware, Stationery, Partyware, Underwear \u2026 to name but a few. As well as my background in Design, I\u2019ve also had some invaluable Fashion Business and PR/Marketing opportunities; working for businesses such as a Creative Marketing Consultation Agency, and a Global Dutch Womenswear Fashion Company. These opportunities gave me the chance to deal with retail giants such as Harvey Nichols, John Lewis and House of Fraser, as well as media headliners such as Drapers and Vogue.  As well as Victoria Hall Design, I also continue to run my \u201cLittle Sister\u201d business Polka Dot Bikini, which offers unique and innovative personalised design and gifts.",

The event was difficult due to poor snow fall meaning the sleds had to run on much smaller and dangerous trails through the mountains. The event was successful in its start to finish goals but unfortunately and very disappointingly due to lack of media interest on completion of the event targeted raised funds fell well short of our goals."
